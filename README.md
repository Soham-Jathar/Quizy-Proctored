# Quizy-Proctored

**QUIZY-PROCTORED** is an intelligent, secure, and scalable web-based quiz and examination platform designed specifically for remote assessments. It integrates real-time proctoring mechanisms to ensure academic integrity in an online environment. The system leverages camera and microphone monitoring, browser activity tracking, and intelligent alerts to detect and deter cheating attempts during exams.

Built with a modern tech stack, QUIZY-PROCTORED offers a seamless experience for both examiners and examinees. Examiners can easily create quizzes, assign them to users, and monitor their activity live, while students can take exams in a controlled, user-friendly interface.

**❗Note:** Make sure camera and microphone permissions are allowed in your browser before attempting to take a test. The platform may not function properly otherwise.
